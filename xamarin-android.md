# How to install xamarin-android for Rider

## 1. Xamarin.Android package

1. Download the current release of Xamarin.Android from the build server: https://dev.azure.com/xamarin/public/_build?definitionId=48&_a=summary
2. Pick one where both stages were successfull and click on it.
3. In the "Summary" box, check for "Related" and click on "n published" below it.
4. Download the "installers-unsigned - Linux" (Using the 3 dots menu on the far right)
5. Unzip the downloaded file.
6. If possible install using your package manager. <br>
6.1 **Arch Linux users**: You can install the .deb package using "debtap"<br>
6.2 sudo debtap -U<br>
6.3 sudo debtap -U < deb_file ><br>
6.4 Enter Packager name: xamarin-android
6.5 When asked to edit the .PGKINFO file, do so with your favourite editor (select number 4 and enter xed) and remove any invalid, or not needed dependency. (In my case I removed c, c0 and java8-sdk)<br>

## 2. Adding udev rules

Use the rules from android-udev (or android-udev-gitAUR), install them manually from Android developer, or use the following template for your udev rules, just replace [VENDOR ID] and [PRODUCT ID] with yours. Copy these rules into /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules:

/etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="[VENDOR ID]", MODE="0660", GROUP="adbusers"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb",ATTR{idVendor}=="[VENDOR ID]",ATTR{idProduct}=="[PRODUCT ID]",SYMLINK+="android_adb"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb",ATTR{idVendor}=="[VENDOR ID]",ATTR{idProduct}=="[PRODUCT ID]",SYMLINK+="android_fastboot"

Then, to reload your new udev rules, execute:

# udevadm control --reload-rules

Make sure you are member of adbusers user group to access adb devices. 

## 3. Install java8

sudo pacman -S --noconfirm jdk8-openjdk

## 4. Rider
1. In your Rider settings, search for "Android" and set the following fields (should be under "Build, Execution, Deployment" --> "Android"):<br>
1.1 Android SDK Location (e.g. /home/user/Android/Sdk)<br>
1.2 Android NDK Location (e.g. /home/user/Android/Sdk/ndk/< version >)<br>
1.3 Java Development Kit Location (e.g. /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-adoptopenjdk)
2. Also check your mono and dotnet settings, search for "Mono" (should be under "Build, Execution, Deployment" --> "Toolset and Build".

2. Click on "More actions" --> SDK Manager
3. Under "SDK Platforms" install the desired API-levels.
4. Under "SDK Tools" make sure that the following are installed:<br>
4.1 Android SDK Build-Tools<br>
4.2 NDK (Side by side)<br>
4.3 Android SDK Command-line Tools<br>
4.4 CMake<br>
4.5 Android Emulator<br>
4.6 Android SDK Platform-Tools

## Resource file missing

Next up, I got the following error:

Source file '/home/acu/RiderProjects/App1/App1/App1.Android/Resources/Resource.Designer.cs' could not be found.

Nasty error, what I figured out is that this problem happens because Linux is case sensitive (Windows isn't).

In the Android project file "<same_name>.Droid.csproj" there's the following line:

<AndroidResgenFile>Resources\Resource.designer.cs</AndroidResgenFile>

And a bit further down in the same file, there's the following:

<Compile Include="Resources\Resource.Designer.cs" />

As far as the Linux file system is concerned, Resource.Designer.cs and Resource.designer.cs are different files. You can fix the casing in either line - and the error's gone.

And that's it, now I was able to compile the Android project successfully
